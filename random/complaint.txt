Hi everyone!

I subscribed to a Hathway Broadband connection in North Delhi on 28th June, 2015 and my ordeal with them began since then. They were quick to setup the connection (it took them three days including the wiring to the pole) and I got the connection working on 1st July in the evening. However, within 3 hours of installation, the connection went offline. The connection came online after half an hour so I thought this was a minor glitch.

In the first week of the connection, there were long periods of disconnection and the severe downtime made the connection almost unreliable. Numerous complaints to the CC were effective only for a few hours, after which the connection went back to its helpless state. While writing this thread too, the connection went offline. There were a few instances in the past weeks where the connection was not online for even a single minute during the day.

This experience has left me in agony and I would never suggest a service provider as pathetic as Hathway (at least in my area).
