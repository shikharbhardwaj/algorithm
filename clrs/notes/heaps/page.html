</head><body><u><span style="font-size: 36pt">Heap<br/>
</span></u>This is a short note regarding the use of the heap data structure in implementing an efficient priority queue.<br/>
<br/>
A heap is a nearly complete binary tree stored in a well defined order of priority.<br/>
The order of priority is decided by the presence of keys associated with each node.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 16pt"><b>Heap properties</b></span><br/>
The heap can have two kinds of properties : The max-heap property and the min-heap property.<br/>
<br/>
Max-heap : a heap has the max heap property if, for each node, the key of the children is &lt;= the key of the node.<br/>
Min-heap : a heap has the min heap property if, for each node, the key of the childeren is &gt;= the key of the node.<br/>
<br/>
These properties can be established in an unordered heap using the methods `build-max-heap`</body></html>
